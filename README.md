### Introduction
Dota2 Invoker Keys is basically a shortcut to play Invoker. Invoker is a complex hero, one has 
to be so quick but some people despite of how much they try cant make it up to 
the mark. Threfore I wrote this simple script which allows you to play Invoker
very easily.

Lets suppose I want to use the sun-strike now if I was not using this script
I would have to press
```.net
E => E => E => R
```
to invoke the spell and then press
```
T
```
(the spell cast key) to cast the spell.
Now if I am using this script all I have to do is press 
```
(Left-Alt + T)
```
to invoke the spell and then press
```
T
```
(the spell cast key) to use the spell. <span style="color:red">Remember *Left-Alt* key and the spell-cast key are to be pressed simultaneously.</span>

### Customizing the Script
In case if someone wants to modifyy the script, enhance it for some other hero or to modify existing code for their ease e.g. change the key to something else like from *Left-Alt* to *space-bar* key etc. they can do so. The script is written in [**AutoHotkey**](https://autohotkey.com/) scripting language.

You will have to download and install AutoHotkey on your computer. After installation, modify the script as needed and then save the file. Then *right-click* the script file and select "Compile script" from the menu. This will generate an executable binary file with the same name as the script-file in the same directory. Run this executable and enjoy the game.
