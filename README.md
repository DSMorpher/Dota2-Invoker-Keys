Dota2 Invoker keys    
Current Version: 1.0    

	Basically its a shortcut to play Invoker. Invoker is a complex hero, one has 
to be so quick but some people despite of how much they try cant make it up to 
the mark. Threfore I have made this simple script which allows you to play Invoker
very easily.

	Lets suppose I want to use the sun-strike now if I was not using this script
I would have to press
					E => E => E => R => then T to use the spell
					
	Now what if I am using this script all I have to do is 
					(LeftAlt + T) => then T to use the spell
					
Remember Left Alt and the spell button are to be pressed simultaneously.

	Furthermore the script uses the following tool
auto hot key https://autohotkey.com/ to compile the script. If someone wants to 
Change the key to something else like from Left Alt to space button etc. They 
will be needing this tool to compile the script again.
